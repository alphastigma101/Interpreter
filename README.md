### Getting Started:
* To get started, type `make` inside the root of the project and execute `exec_interpreter`. The interpreter can parse raw binary expressions and can interpret a cutom language called `tactical nuke`. You can view tactical nuke's syntax inside `Code Analysis`.If typing `make` inside the root folder does not work, then the codebase itself is getting updated. If this is the case, then navigate over to the folder called `debugging`. There is a file called `Makefile.sh` that will compile the project. You can also run  unit tests from that folder or feed in your own data into the interpreter or parser to see what it does. 

### Product Construction
* The goal is to create a hand-made interpreter that processes a language called Tatical Nuke. This whole project is written in c++.

### What Is Tatical Nuke
* Tatical nuke is custom language I developed myself. It uses c++ syntax. It will be a lighter version of c++, and should be used to build `operating systems` 
* ***Pros***:
    * Tatical Nuke is a language that I implemented myself. It is inspired by low level languages and has a mixture of keywords from modern languages. 
    * It uses JavaScript's callback syntax and also has inheritance.
    * It is less strict than c++ but should offer the same performance.
    * To create classes you type `containment`, and `MUSHROOMCLOUD` to include other code files that end with `.nuke`. 
    * Basic Keywords it suports `int`, `void`, `double`, `string`, `char`, references `&`, and raw pointers `*`. **Note** that references and pointers will not be supported when interpreting tatical nuke. It will be avialable when compiling it. The compiler will be on a different repo. 
* ***Cons***:
* It will either display a mini nuke or a big nuke and drop on a family of stick figures, if and only if the programmer itself messes up on the syntax. 

### Project Motivation and Potential Applications

This project serves as my inaugural venture into crafting a customly made language inspired by c++. Beyond this primary goal, I'm eager to explore how the techniques I learn can be applied to various domains in software development and data processing. Some intriguing areas for future exploration include:

- Parsing complex configuration files
- Handling data serialization formats
- Creating and processing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
- Advancing natural language processing capabilities
- Developing compiler front-ends
- Interpreting query languages
- Building code analysis and static checking tools
- Enhancing document processing systems

### Contributation
* Callobaration is possible for this project. Please make a pull requests with your name, and preferable an issue of some sort.
